we know about software architectures, development techniques, large scale
integration and so, is just a detail.</p><p>Our customer will pay us to solve his own problems.</p><p>He don’t want to know about agility, software integration, CAP theorems,
cloud computing, data security or computational complexity: these are
technicalities that he would avoid at all. These are our problems!</p><p>Enterprise customers pay us to get a competitive advantage by solving well
known problems of their own. They don’t want new, unknown, problems to pay us
for!</p><p>Nevertheless, even as "hands on" modelers, we often undervalue their "human"
problems.
Whenever we adapt the models of our customer’s problem domain to our existing
frameworks, we are mixing two order of complexities: business rules and
technological constraints.</p><p>"I don’t fight my framework!" you would say. Evans explicitly wrote that we
should not. Actually, most of the times it is the wisest choice.</p><p>But what if you had a framework that hasn’t to be fought? What if you could
easily adapt any infrastructure to clean models that capture the
business processes only?</p><p>What if we could simply code nothing but business?</p><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="about_a_dependency_inversion"></a>A dependency inversion</h2></div></div></div><p>In 2004 the European Union issued the Markets in Financial Instruments
Directive (also known as MiFID). The main objectives of the directive
were to increase competition and consumer protection in investment services.
Suddenly many big banks all over the europe begun to adapt their advisory
softwares.
Many software companies (and consulting firms) clashed with a complex
legislation to rule existing business processes, in an heterogeneous set of
technological environments.</p><p>Four years later the European Union amended the directive, already adopted
by many states, variously changing the rules.</p><p>We soon realized that it was a strategic point to keep the domain fully
indipendent from the infrastructural choises that each bank would had taken.
Moreover the problem was too complex to take technological compromises.
We had to protect the model as the most important asset in our stack.
We had to base our entire stack on the domain model itself, adapting
everything else.</p><p>But unfortunately, Epic did not exist.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="about_what_is_epic"></a>What is Epic?</h2></div></div></div><p>After a long climb towards trials, failures and insights, we realized a set of
modeling patterns and practices that works very well together against complex
domains.</p><p>We took so much confidence in such patterns, that when we now see problems in
their adoption, we often start a new whirpool to get a deeper insight of the
context. Such process often shows a misunderstanding in the domain language.</p><p>At the core, Epic is a coherent set of modeling patterns, best practices
and lessons learned (with a lots of anti-patterns to avoid: did you know that
lazy loading and event brokers are among our new singletons?).</p><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="about_more_than_theories"></a>More than theories</h3></div></div></div><p>As you will see, some of the patterns we propose are really challenging from
a technological point of view.</p><p>If not taken together as a whole, they could seem impossible to implement.
Actually, they <span class="strong"><strong>are</strong></span> impossible to implement (correctly) if mixed with those we
propose as anti-patterns. We learned this the hard way.</p><p>So what?</p><p>Well, Epic is more than a set of coherent patterns: we designed a framework and
a set of tools to inject the infrastructure into the domain model itself,
without any need to adapt it.</p><p>Epic will help you to</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem">
reduce the effort to code and maintain the model implementation
</li><li class="listitem">
enforce the aderence to patterns (if you want to)
</li><li class="listitem">
adapt the infrastructure you need to the model itself (persistence, caching
  and so on will be orthogonal to the modeling code)
</li><li class="listitem">
build complex, beautiful and highly interactive user-interfaces
</li><li class="listitem">
follow a simple, predictable and traceable development process, that

On the contrary, you should
invest a lot on them! Whenever you have any doubt about the business, stop
coding, kidnap the domain expert and start a new exploration whirpool.</p><p>Moreover, it require high skills in object oriented design. Such skills are
rather expensive to acquire and thus building a productive team using Epic will
require budget. As a conseguence Epic will minimize the development efforts
and maximize the software quality (cutting maintenance’s costs), but will not
reduce the budgets required.</p><p>Keep this in mind: Epic could overwhelm simple projects!</p><p>Avoid Epic (and domain driven design) when you do not have complex business
rules and do not require high reliability while sticking to such rules.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="about_target_audience"></a>Target audience</h2></div></div></div><p>This manual is targeted to people involved in the entire lifecycle of
enterprise applications with custom development.
An obvious prerequisite is a good experience in software development and
object oriented design. Furthermore a good understanding of the Evans book is
mandatory.</p><p>Here software architects and software developers could learn when to
adopt the Epic framework, and how to adapt it to their architecture and
development processes.</p><p>Project managers could use the manual to grasp the development process emerging
from a domain driven team using Epic.
In particular, they will appreciate the concreteness that Epic
imposes to the development process, always looking for a better understanding
of the customers' processes.</p><p>Modelers and developers will gain a set of powerful tools, that will
increase their ability to cut complexity into indipendent axes, allowing an
easy parallelization of development efforts.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="about_the_structure_of_this_manual"></a>The structure of this manual</h2></div></div></div><p>The first part of the manual introduce patterns and practices that come from
real-life challenges encountered by a team of developers building corporate
applications.
Such patterns will constrain (and thus will ease) the design, the development
and the evolution of the domain model itself.
As such it is mostly written for "hands on" modelers and architects.</p><p>The second part document the various components of the Epic framework.
It’s designed for the full development team (from DBA to GUI designers).</p><p>Finally, the third part will target architects, team leaders and project
managers, describing the process' changes that could be required by the
adoption of Epic.</p></div></div><div class="navfooter"><hr /><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="manual.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"> </td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="a_shared_modeling_grammar.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">Dominant Domains </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="manual.html">Table of Contents</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> Part I. Toward a shared modeling grammar</td></tr></table></div></div></div></div><div id="footer"><div class="copyright">Copyright © 2010-2013 Giacomo Tesio</div></div><script type="text/javascript">SyntaxHighlighter.all()</script></body></html>
